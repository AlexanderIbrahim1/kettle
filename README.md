# mini-qiskit

This is the mini-qiskit project.

I am attempting to reimplement the versions of MicroQiskit presented in the following two links:
- https://github.com/qiskit-community/MicroQiskit/blob/main/versions/C%2B%2B/MicroQiskitCpp.h
- https://github.com/qiskit-community/MicroQiskit/blob/main/microqiskit.py

# TODO
- improve README to make it easier for viewers to navigate the project
- include implementations of common algorithms
